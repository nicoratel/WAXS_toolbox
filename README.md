# WAXS_toolbox
WAXS_toolbox is a software suite dedicated to the structural analysis of nanoparticles. 
It allows the following features:
- Generation of structural models from cif files
- Generation of non standard monometallic nanostructures such as icosahedron, decahedron or octahedron shapes
- Simulation of Scattering data and Pair Distribution Function from structural models
- Structure refinement based on experimental pair distribution function

Check the documentation for more information. Tutorial examples are also avalaible.
